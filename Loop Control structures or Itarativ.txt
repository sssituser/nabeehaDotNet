		Loop Control structures or Itarative statements or 


In order to execute particular block of stmts no of times based on requirement.

1.Entry Controlled Structure. since It checks be before executing the stmts.

Case 1: BE-->False  compiler will not execute any stmt.

Case2 : BE---> True compiler executes while block stmts,and check be again if the be-true
       compiler executes while block stmts till the be reaches to false



	While(booleanEx){
		
	stmts

	}

	1.Write a program to print a stmt 10 time
	i.e   stmts is "WELCOME TO ONLINE TRAINING"

	2.Write a program to read a number and generate numbers for the given number
	 from 1 to till the number

	num = 10    1
		    2

		   ..
		  10

	3.Write a program to read a number and generate numbers from number to 1

	num = 5		5,4,3,2,1
	num =10         10,9,...1


	4.Write to find out sum of given number.

	num = 5 => 1+2+3+4+5 => 15
	num = 100 => 
	5. num = 5    fact = 1*2*3*4*5 => fact= 120


	Write a program to find the reverse of a given number.

	num = 123  => Reverse => 321
	num = 12
	num = 1
	steps : separate last digit : 3 *10+2=>32*10+1=>321
/ --> quo
% --> rem
	123%10 ==> 3
	123/10 ==> 12

	Write a program to check given number is Palindrome  or not ?

	num = 123  reverse = 321 => num  reverse number are not equal  given number is not
	num = 141  reverse = 141 is palindrome
	num = 313  

	Write a program to check given number is Armstrong or not

	Write a program to check given number is Prime or not







	num = 123     123 







	












	do{

	
	}while(BE);

do-while loop can be called exit controlled structre

All while loop programs can be converted into do-while

            (1)  (2)  (4)
	for(intown;++/--){

		stms(3)
	}

In for loop  initialization can be done only once, compiler repeats 2,3,4,2,3,4 till con
reaches to false.







	foreach(datatype var1 in var2){
